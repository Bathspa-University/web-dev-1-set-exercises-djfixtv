                        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into evenly sized chunks.</li>
                        <li>Rinse the potato chunks under cold water to remove excess starch.</li>

                        <li>Place the potato chunks in a large pot and cover them with cold water.</li>
                        <li>Add a generous pinch of salt to the water.</li>
                        <li>Bring the water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Heat the Milk and Butter:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, heat the milk and butter in a small saucepan over low heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm. Do not boil.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                        <li>Once the potatoes are cooked, drain them well and return them to the pot.</li>
                        <li>Mash the potatoes using a potato masher or a ricer until they reach your desired consistency. Some prefer smooth mashed potatoes, while others like them a bit chunky.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Add the Milk and Butter Mixture:</h3>

                        <li>Gradually pour the warm milk and butter mixture into the mashed potatoes, stirring gently to incorporate. Add more milk if needed to achieve the desired creaminess.</li>
                        <li>If using heavy cream, add it at this stage for extra richness.</li>
                    </ul>
