        <h2>Plot Overview</h2>
        <hr> <!-- Horizontal rule -->
        <p class="POV">Undertale follows Frisk, a human child who falls into the Underground, a world beneath the Earth's surface that serves as home to banished monsters from a past war with humans. As Frisk tries to return to the surface, they must explore the different areas of the Underground and interact with its inhabitants.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>During their journey, Frisk meets several characters, such as Toriel who acts as a nurturing guide, Sans and Papyrus who are funny skeleton siblings, Undyne who is the leader of the Royal Guard, Alphys who is a timid scientist, and Asgore who is the ruler of the Underground.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>In Undertale, the gameplay focuses on the player's choices when interacting with characters and conflicts can be resolved through negotiation or combat. The combat system is distinctive, allowing players to use a "mercy" system to spare enemies and avoid violence.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>As Frisk moves forward, they uncover the history of the Underground, including the tragic past of humans and monsters, the magical barrier that separates them, and the repercussions of breaking it. The game delves into themes of friendship, morality, and accountability.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>Undertale has a non-linear storyline that changes based on the player's decisions. Decisions like showing mercy or using violence affect the direction the story takes, and ultimately determine the fate of characters and the game world. Undertale encourages players to think about the consequences of their actions and how they affect the game's outcome.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>Undertale delivers a gripping and emotional story that infuses humor, suspense, and heartfelt moments, making for a remarkable journey through the Underground.<br>&nbsp;

                Undertale is a masterpiece. It thrives in subverting your expectations of a typical RPG in every way. And I mean it, in every way. From worldbuilding to combat to characters, everything you expect will be thrown out the window.
                You will come to love the characters for how well written & believable they are. The most minor, trivial character from this game oozes more personality than a lot of games do.
                The writing makes the game feel so immersive thanks to how believable & cohesive it is. The multi-layered & rich themes are gonna leave you thinking of this game LONG after you're done with it.
                The music is superb. Though that much is clearly evident by the widespread presence in meme culture.
                The combat is extremely unique & brings out the best of bullet hell & turn based systems.
                It's the only game where I've ever truly felt that my choices matter despite never advertising as such.
                <br><br>
                Overall, I simply cannot recommend this game enough. It is a masterpiece through & through with no dull moment. I don't do number ratings usually but for Undertale it's an easy 10/10

                At a first glance, Undertale probably looks like any other bland/low budget RPG but looks can be deceiving. Underneath the pixelated exterior lies a gem that I would consider to be the crown jewel of indie games: a highly successful kickstarter that was conceptualized and developed (mostly) by one person (Toby Fox).
                To this day, I still reminisce about my multiple playthroughs and still regularly listen to the soundtrack (and covers). Simply thinking about the game fills me with determination.

                This is one of those few games that come along when times are bleak, and games have become regularly bland and heartless. Where you feel disenfranchised with the whole idea of video games. And you begin to start ask "Why?"... Like "Why should we play games?", "Why are games different from other media?", "Why should you use games as a form of expression?" and even "Why even play games at all?!"
                <br><br>
                Undertale come along and says, "This is why."

                When I first heard of Undertale, I had no interest in playing it. I thought the fanbase was massively cringeworthy and the game was probably uninteresting.
                I was correct about the fanbase, but boy was I wrong about the game.
                <br><br>
                I normally play action/adventure RPG games with the occasional sprinkling of singleplayer FPS. I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was.
                <br><br>
                In reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time. And above all else, it manages to be heart-rendingly (no pun indended) sad at times and actually funny at other times. Plus, the music is fantastic and the whole package has a level of care I don't often see anymore.
                <br><br>
                You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this game out. And I don't say that lightly.
                <br><br>
                <strong>Story/writing:</strong> 10<br>
                <strong>Music:</strong> 8<br>
                <strong>Replay value:</strong> 7<br>
                <strong>Gameplay:</strong> 6 for the actual fun of it, but I'll give it a 7 just because of how inventive the mercy system is. This is an RPG you can play without killing anything.
