        <h2>Plot Overview</h2>
        <hr> <!-- Horizontal rule -->
        <p class="POV">Undertale follows Frisk, a human child who falls into the Underground, a world beneath the Earth's surface that serves as home to banished monsters from a past war with humans. As Frisk tries to return to the surface, they must explore the different areas of the Underground and interact with its inhabitants.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>During their journey, Frisk meets several characters, such as Toriel who acts as a nurturing guide, Sans and Papyrus who are funny skeleton siblings, Undyne who is the leader of the Royal Guard, Alphys who is a timid scientist, and Asgore who is the ruler of the Underground.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>In Undertale, the gameplay focuses on the player's choices when interacting with characters and conflicts can be resolved through negotiation or combat. The combat system is distinctive, allowing players to use a "mercy" system to spare enemies and avoid violence.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>As Frisk moves forward, they uncover the history of the Underground, including the tragic past of humans and monsters, the magical barrier that separates them, and the repercussions of breaking it. The game delves into themes of friendship, morality, and accountability.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>Undertale has a non-linear storyline that changes based on the player's decisions. Decisions like showing mercy or using violence affect the direction the story takes, and ultimately determine the fate of characters and the game world. Undertale encourages players to think about the consequences of their actions and how they affect the game's outcome.
            <br>&nbsp;<br>Undertale delivers a gripping and emotional story that infuses humor, suspense, and heartfelt moments, making for a remarkable journey through the Underground.<br>&nbsp;
